# OpenBuild Essentials
OBE (OpenBuild Essentials) is an open source Minecraft resource pack for Bedrock Edition made to help creation easier for Bedrock creators.

## Your Work in our pack
Please by all means add a sneaky watermark somewhere either in the namespace or textures. The namespace isn't *required* to be `openbuild:`, but please include the namespaces in the contribs_list and HTML files for each folder.

## Compatibility
For now, we aren't allowing any Behaviour Packs/Scripts as it's too easy to backdoor and a big risk for us. This pack is ***bedrock only*** so please don't be asking us about Javascript/Modded compatibility.
